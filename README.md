What's JoinHour.com?
---------------------
It's a service that connects collocated people to do an activity together. It's like a real time meetup for ad-hoc activities & spontaneous events with zero planning. If you were reading a banner on a side of our building it would read: "Making just-in-time connections between collocated people.""

What makes JoinHour.com unique?
------------------------------------
All relationships, friendships, and connections always start with meeting someone new. A traditinal non-awkward way to meet new people is through friends and colleagues. But your social network can't help you meet people around you in a non-awkward way. JoinHour.com facilitates introductions and makes connections with new people around you based on mutual activity interests. Best of all the connections a just-in-time, the people are good, and there is zero expectations for joiners to become friends.
